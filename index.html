                <p>Looking back at your application, we got everything you promised: strategic thinking, a passion for nonprofits and heavy amounts of sarcasm. And as it turns out, we got far more than we ever could have hoped for.</p>

                    <p>"My journey to the nonprofit sector started when I began feeling that my marketing curriculum had a materialistic focus, and I craved something more. I found Wired Impact when researching media tactics for a nonprofit campaign supporting Take Back the Night, a march against interpersonal violence, in Lexington. I'm not a counselor, but I realized I could give to nonprofits with the skills I have in strategic planning, budgeting and execution.</p>

                    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Kentucky, and I am searching for a job where I can interact with people--better yet, passionate advocates! I am my best self when I can invest in others. In freshmen year as a Resident Advisor on campus or in survivors of violence as they heal--I have found that I can easily distinguish what a person needs to feel supported. I will bring this enthusiasm and impactful thinking to Wired Impact.</p>

                    <p>On the side, I am fluent in sarcasm and have a healthy appreciation for donuts and large coffees!"</p>

She was extremely responsive, helpful, easy to work with, and I felt like she really understood what we wanted as an organization for our website. Since I was the only person managing the project on my end, it was wonderful to have her support with nudging the process forward and keeping me focused on the launch goal. I loved working with her!"</p>
